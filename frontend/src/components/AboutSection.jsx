          PerspectAI is built to solve the world’s biggest problem: <strong>information overload</strong>. 
          Every day, millions of people face misinformation, incomplete data, manipulated narratives, 
          and complex global events that are hard to understand.
        </p>
        <p className="section-text">
          We created PerspectAI as a real-time intelligence engine that thinks, analyzes, verifies, 
          and communicates like a human — but operates at machine speed. Our mission is to make truth 
          accessible, research effortless, and global awareness available to everyone.
